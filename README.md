# !! BUILD DOWNLOAD
[Stable Release (compiled by us)](https://github.com/Adrigamer278/bloxstrap/releases/latest)  
[Latest Commit [aka a Dev Build] (compiled by github automatically) (use .exe from latest workflow artifact that requires you to have a github account)](https://github.com/Adrigamer278/bloxstrap/actions/workflows/ci-release.yml?query=is%3Asuccess+branch%3Amain)

## How to install
Running the exe or replacing it with bloxstap's exe should install/update the fork  
If it doesnt work try installing normal bloxstrap and then repeating the step before should work  
Bloxstrap installation path (where bloxstrap's exe file is) is <i>%localappdata%/Bloxstrap</i> (use Win+R or the file explorer address path to go there)

# <b>[Project: AE](https://www.roblox.com/groups/17371285/Project-AE)'s Fork</b>  
Features:  
    - [Window Movement](https://youtu.be/MgWMiGAx68g?si=1SOBrE3CMPgg8lhC&t=96)  
    - [Changing Window's Title and Chroma color](https://youtu.be/i03Aiic6DbI?si=XzGEkdJkqdEbOu-C&t=112)

Note: On smaller screens (includes DPI zoomed screens), roblox may force a minimum size for the window, to remove it you can enable fullscreen, which also removes the window border but everytime you click the window it will fullscreen until the game sends a window update (we can't do anything about it afaik)

EXAMPLE CODE (FOR BLOXSTRAPRPC SDK)

```luau
-- scaleWidth and scaleHeight are the screen size used for window data, so it can be scaled in other screens
-- might change naming to baseWidth and baseHeight in the future
local next = next;
local round = math.round;

export type Window = {
    x:				number?,
    y: 				number?,
    width:			number?,
    height: 			number?,

    scaleWidth: 		number?,
    scaleHeight: 		number?,

    reset:			boolean?,
}

-- note: since fflags are getting whitelisted, this method may not work in the future, an alternative way for detection is in the works
function GetFFlag(flag)
	local suc,result = pcall(function()
		return UserSettings():IsUserFeatureEnabled(flag);
	end)

	return suc and result or false;
end

local winMovementAllowed = GetFFlag("UserAllowsWindowMovement");

local prevWinData = {}

function makeDiff(a, b)
    local new = {};
    for k,v in b do
        new[k] = v;
    end

    for k,v in a do 
        if new[k]==v then   new[k] = nil   end
    end
    return new
end

function BloxstrapRPC.SetWindow(data:Window)
    if not winMovementAllowed then return end;

    if data.reset then
        BloxstrapRPC.SendMessage("SetWindow", {reset=true});
        prevWinData = {};
        return;
    end

    data.reset = nil;

    for i,v in data do
        data[i] = round(v)
    end

    local diff = makeDiff(prevWinData,data)
    if not next(diff) then return end;

    prevWinData = data;

    BloxstrapRPC.SendMessage("SetWindow", diff)
end
```

Bloxstrap is a third-party replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, providing additional useful features and improvements.

Running into a problem or need help with something? [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/wiki). If you can't find anything, or would like to suggest something, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/issues).

Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for us to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only two official sources are this GitHub repository and [bloxstraplabs.com](https://bloxstraplabs.com).

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. Bloxstrap doesn't interact with the Roblox client in the same way that exploits do. [Read more about that here.](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/wiki/Why-it's-not-reasonably-possible-for-you-to-be-banned-by-Bloxstrap)

**Q: Why was multi-instance launching removed?**

**A:** It was removed starting with v2.6.0 for the [reasons stated here](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/wiki/Plans-to-remove-multi%E2%80%90instance-launching-from-Bloxstrap). It may be added back in the future when there are less issues with doing so.

## Features

- Hassle-free Discord Rich Presence to let your friends know what you're playing at a glance
- Simple support for modding of content files for customizability (death sound, mouse cursor, etc)
- See where your server is geographically located (courtesy of [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io))
- Ability to configure graphics fidelity and UI experience

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Alternatively, you can install Bloxstrap via [Winget](https://winstall.app/apps/pizzaboxer.Bloxstrap) by running this in a Command Prompt window:
```
> winget install bloxstrap
```

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.

## Code

Bloxstrap uses the [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) library for the user interface design. We currently use and maintain our own fork of WPF UI at [bloxstraplabs/wpfui](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/wpfui).
